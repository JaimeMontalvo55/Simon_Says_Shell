# SYMON SAYS SHELL
# WeÂ´ve created a shell based on the popular game of symon says!!!
## This shell contains three brand new comands:
# Command 1: Color
## By writing this command, a new button will appear in the top right corner, which allows the user to change the background to a random new color
# Command 2: Symon
## This command will make a new window appear, where the user can play the popular memory game, in which the difficulty will increase with every new round
# Command 3: multiplayer_match
## This functionality creates a "notebook" that will help keeping track of the records of up to 4 players simultaniously, in case the users desires to play with opponents
